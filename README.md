# WindowTabs

WindowTabs is a utility which brings browser-style tabbed window management to the desktop.

It was originally developped by Maurice Flanagan in 2009 and was back then provided as a free and paid version. 
The author has now open-sourced the utility. See the original repository here : https://github.com/mauricef/WindowTabs

I forked the source code to make learn from it. This is not a maintained version. My fork currently compiles with VS2017 community edition.

Installer doesn't builds (yet).
