# WindowTabs

WindowTabs is a utility which brings browser-style tabbed window management to the desktop.

It was originally developped by Maurice Flanagan in 2009 and was back then provided as a free and paid version.   
The author has now open-sourced the utility. See the original repository here : https://github.com/mauricef/WindowTabs

I forked from payaneco repository which forked from redgis. And it just compiles and runs successfully in my Win7 64bit.
