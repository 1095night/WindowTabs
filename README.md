# WindowTabs

WindowTabs is a utility which brings browser-style tabbed window management to the desktop.

It was originally developped by Maurice Flanagan in 2009 and was back then provided as a free and paid version.   
The author has now open-sourced the utility. See the original repository here : https://github.com/mauricef/WindowTabs

And Mr./Ms. redgis forked and migrated to VS2017 / .NET 4.0. See also the forked repository here : https://github.com/redgis/WindowTabs

I forked the source code to study. My fork currently compiles with VS2017 community edition.

I installed [WiX Toolset build tools](http://wixtoolset.org/) V3.11.1. Then I can compile WtSetup.wixproj and make an installer.  
But it doesn't work on my Windows 10 64bit environments.
