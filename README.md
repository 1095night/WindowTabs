# WindowTabs

WindowTabs is a utility which brings browser-style tabbed window management to the desktop. I created this utility in 2009 and 
provided a free and paid version. I'm now open sourcing it since I no longer have time to maintain it.

## Installation
Install [WindowTabs.msi](http://windowtabs.com/WindowTabs.msi) and then run it, you should see tabs appear on the upper left corner 
of your open windows. 

## Support
I no longer provide support for WindowTabs.
